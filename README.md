# remote-packet-sniffer

A system developed to sniff packets on a remote device, with the help of React, NodeJS, Python, Scapy, and MongoDB. The packetSniffer.py file, which uses the Scapy library, is responsible for sniffing the packets and sending it to MongoDB. The server listens to the requests made from the client side React application to fetch the data from the database live and send it as the response.
